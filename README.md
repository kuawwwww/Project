# Genetic Algorithm in solving TSP (GA)
>   This project uses a genetic algorithm to solve the TSP problem: first a permutation approach encodes the sequence of visited cities, which ensures that each city passes through and only once. Then an initial population is generated and the distance of all cities is traversed to calculate the fitness function. Then selection is performed with Roulette wheel selection, using Partially-matched crossover and simple mutation to determine the crossover operator and variation operator.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
- What is the purpose of your project?
- Why did you undertake it?
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


##  Prerequisites
Baselines requires python3 with the development headers. You'll also need to use a third library: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and time. You can install them (which are themself pip packages) via
```python
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install time
```
