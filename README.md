# Genetic Algorithm in solving TSP
> TSP, or traveling salesman problem: Suppose a traveling salesman has to visit n cities, and he must choose the path to take, with the constraint that each city can only visit once, and finally return to the origin. The optimization goal of the problem is to minimize the path length.
> The genetic algorithm starts from a population of initial solutions. After the generation of the initial population, according to the principle of survival of the fittest and survival of the fittest, better and better approximate solutions are generated from generation to generation. In each generation, individuals are selected according to the fitness of individuals in the problem domain, and the population representing new solution sets is generated by means of combination crossover and mutation of genetic operators of natural genetics. This process will lead to the population like natural evolution, the later generation population is more adapted to the environment than the previous generation, and the optimal individuals in the last population can be decoded as the approximate optimal solution of the problem.
The TSP problem is solved by GA: first the method of permuting and combining the sequence of visiting cities is encoded, which ensures that each city passes through and only passes through once. Then the initial population is generated and the fitness function is calculated, that is, the distance traversed through all cities is calculated. The selection operator is then determined by the optimal preservation method to ensure that the excellent individuals are directly copied to the next generation. Partially-matched crossover and simple mutation are used to determine the crossover operator and mutation operator.
